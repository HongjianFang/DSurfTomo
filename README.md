# DSurfTomo

DSurfTomo is a surface wave inversion program which can directly invert surface wave dispersion data to 3D shear wave speed without the intermediate step of constructing the phase or group velocity maps. 
A fast march method (FMM) is used to compute, at each period, surface wave travel times and ray paths between sources and receivers. 
This avoids the assumption of great-circle propagation that is used in most surface wave tomographic studies, but which is not appropriate in complex media.

For detail description of the method, please refer to: Fang, H., Yao, H., Zhang, H., Huang, Y. C., & van der Hilst, R. D. (2015).

This is the source code without users' manual and examples about how to use it.
If you need a detail description and some examples, feel free to send an email to Hongjian Fang (fanghj@mail.ustc.edu.cn) with a brief introduction about yourself and why you want to use it.

We will be happy to help.
