DSurfTomo is a surface wave tomography program which inverts surface wave dispersion data directly to 3D shear wavespeed models without the intermediate step of constructing the phase or group velocity maps.
The fast marching method (FMM) (Rawlinson et al., 2004) is used to compute, at each period, surface wave travel times and ray paths between sources and receivers. This avoids the assumption of great-circle propagation that is used in most surface wave tomographic studies, but which is not appropriate in complex media. 
To show its usage, an example of Taipei Basin tomography is provided, including scripts that are used for data reformating and plotting results. Interested users are recommended to refer to Fang et al. (2015 , GJI) for the detail description of the method.
