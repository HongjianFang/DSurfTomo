#DSurfTomo
DSurfTomo is the surface wave inversion program which can directly invert surface wave 
dispersion data to 3D shear wave speed without the intermediate step of constructing 
the phase or group velocity maps.A fast march method (FMM) is used to compute, at each 
period, surface wave travel times and ray paths between sources and receivers. This 
avoids the assumption of great-circle propagation that is used in most surface wave 
tomographic studies, but which is not appropriate in complex media.
For detail description of the method, please refer to:

crustal structure based on ray tracing: methodology and application. Geophysical Journal International, 201(3), 1251-1263.

This is the source code without users' manual and examples about how to use it. If you need a detail description and some examples,
feel free to send an email to Hongjian Fang (fanghj@mail.ustc.edu.cn) with a brief introduction about yourself and why you want to 
use it. We will be happy to help.
